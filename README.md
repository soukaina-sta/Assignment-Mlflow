# Student Mental Health Prediction Project

# Main idea 

This project aims to develop a resilient machine learning model designed to predict depression among students, utilizing a range of mental health-related features. 
The workflow encompasses thorough data preprocessing, the training of diverse machine learning models, and the creation of a Flask application to interact with the trained model.
Additionally, the top-performing model is saved in ONNX format, while its preprocessing transformations are stored in a pickle file.
