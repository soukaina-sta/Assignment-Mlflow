# Student Mental Health Prediction Project

# Main idea 

This project aims to develop a resilient machine learning model designed to predict depression among students, utilizing a range of mental health-related features. 
The workflow encompasses thorough data preprocessing, the training of diverse machine learning models, and the creation of a Flask application to interact with the trained model.
Additionally, the top-performing model is saved in ONNX format, while its preprocessing transformations are stored in a pickle file.

# Ml Models |	Using Mlflow :

This project leverages MLflow to manage the deployment and tracking of five distinct machine learning models.

The primary objectives include monitoring model performance, versions, and parameter variations.

To enhance reproducibility, the best-performing model is preserved in the ONNX format. Additionally, the preprocessing transformations specific to this model, implemented using the transformers API, are stored in a pickle file.
